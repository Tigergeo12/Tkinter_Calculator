Anonymous: Unlike regular functions defined using the def keyword, lambda functions do not have a name. This is why they are often referred to as anonymous functions.

Single Expression: A lambda function can only contain a single expression. This expression is evaluated and returned when the function is called. You cannot include multiple statements or complex logic.

Return Value: The result of the expression is automatically returned; you do not need to use the return statement.

Use Cases: lambda functions are often used in situations where you need a small function for a short period of time and do not want to formally define it with a name. Common use cases include:

As arguments to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments).
In functional programming constructs like map(), filter(), and reduce().
